first project:
This program is a simple console-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low until the user correctly guesses the number. The game is designed to be interactive and engaging, helping users improve their problem-solving skills and understanding of basic programming concepts.
